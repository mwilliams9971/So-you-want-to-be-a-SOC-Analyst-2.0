# Cloud SOC 2.0 Lab

## Overview

After reading the blog series *"So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst"*, I decided to try out the **Cloud SOC 2.0 Lab** to get hands-on experience and see if I would enjoy working in security operations. This lab focused on building a cloud-based SOC environment, simulating real-world scenarios, and practicing threat detection and response using tools like Azure Sentinel and LimaCharlie.

## Lab Components

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Cloud-Based Virtual Machine**: Deployed a pre-configured, cloud-hosted virtual machine to serve as the primary environment, eliminating the need for local VM setups.
- **LimaCharlie EDR Integration**: Installed the LimaCharlie Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent to monitor system activities and collect security telemetry.

### 2. Command and Control Simulation
- **Sliver C2 Framework**: Set up the Sliver Command and Control (C2) server within the virtual machine to simulate adversarial activities.
- **Payload Deployment**: Generated and executed payloads to establish C2 sessions, facilitating the simulation of common attack vectors.

### 3. Adversarial Activities
- **Privilege Escalation**: Performed actions to elevate privileges within the system, mimicking tactics used by malicious actors.
- **Credential Dumping**: Executed techniques to extract sensitive information, such as dumping the `lsass.exe` process, to understand potential data exposure risks.

### 4. Detection and Response
- **LimaCharlie Telemetry Analysis**: Monitored and analyzed security events generated by LimaCharlie to identify indicators of compromise.
- **Custom Detection Rules**: Developed and implemented rules to detect specific malicious activities, enhancing the system's threat detection capabilities.
- **Blocking Malicious Actions**: Configured automated responses to prevent identified threats, such as blocking the deletion of volume shadow copiesâ€”a common ransomware tactic.

### 5. Advanced Threat Detection
- **Automated YARA Scanning**: Integrated YARA rules into the environment to automatically scan for known malware signatures, improving the detection of malicious files and processes.

## Key Learnings

Adversarial Simulations
Used the Sliver C2 framework to simulate attacks like C2 sessions and reconnaissance, gaining insight into how attackers operate.

Detection and Response
Built and tested detection rules in Azure Sentinel and monitored endpoint activity with LimaCharlie to identify and respond to malicious behavior.

Blocking Threats
Implemented rules in LimaCharlie to block payload execution and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive processes like lsass.exe.

Building and Managing a Lab
Set up a cloud-based lab with virtual machines and integrated tools to practice security monitoring, threat detection, and attack mitigation.
