## Setting Up LimaCharlie
This document outlines how I set up LimaCharlie for my SOC Analyst 2.0 Lab based on the [original guide](https://detailed-leo-854.notion.site/Part-1-Setup-LimaCharlie-3dc0206d35db4d28ad80cc3004688d41).

### Steps I Followed
1. Created an account on LimaCharlie and configured the organization.
2. Generated an API key for endpoint integration.
3. Installed the LimaCharlie agent on the virtual machine.
4. Verified telemetry was successfully ingested into the dashboard.
5. Customized data views to align with SOC workflows.
