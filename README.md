# Cloud SOC 2.0 Lab

## Overview

After reading the blog series *"So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst"*, I decided to try out the **Cloud SOC 2.0 Lab** to get hands-on experience and see if I would enjoy working in security operations. This lab focused on building a cloud-based SOC environment, simulating real-world scenarios, and practicing threat detection and response using tools like Azure Sentinel and LimaCharlie.

## Lab Components

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Cloud-Based Virtual Machine**: Deployed a pre-configured, cloud-hosted virtual machine to serve as the primary environment, eliminating the need for local VM setups.
- **LimaCharlie EDR Integration**: Installed the LimaCharlie Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent to monitor system activities and collect security telemetry.

### 2. Command and Control Simulation
- **Sliver C2 Framework**: Set up the Sliver Command and Control (C2) server within the virtual machine to simulate adversarial activities.
- **Payload Deployment**: Generated and executed payloads to establish C2 sessions, facilitating the simulation of common attack vectors.

### 3. Adversarial Activities
- **Privilege Escalation**: Performed actions to elevate privileges within the system, mimicking tactics used by malicious actors.
- **Credential Dumping**: Executed techniques to extract sensitive information, such as dumping the `lsass.exe` process, to understand potential data exposure risks.

### 4. Detection and Response
- **LimaCharlie Telemetry Analysis**: Monitored and analyzed security events generated by LimaCharlie to identify indicators of compromise.
- **Custom Detection Rules**: Developed and implemented rules to detect specific malicious activities, enhancing the system's threat detection capabilities.
- **Blocking Malicious Actions**: Configured automated responses to prevent identified threats, such as blocking the deletion of volume shadow copiesâ€”a common ransomware tactic.

### 5. Advanced Threat Detection
- **Automated YARA Scanning**: Integrated YARA rules into the environment to automatically scan for known malware signatures, improving the detection of malicious files and processes.
