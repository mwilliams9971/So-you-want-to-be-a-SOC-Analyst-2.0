# So-you-want-to-be-a-SOC-Analyst-2.0
This repository contains my implementation of the SOC Analyst 2.0 Lab, inspired by the blog series by E. Capuano. The lab is designed to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, leveraging Azure tools and services to develop hands-on experience in threat detection, analysis, and response.
